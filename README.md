# f1-ga-project

This was a project for a course I took through General Assembly on beginning Javascript and React. It was made using the Ergast developer API (http://ergast.com/mrd/). It is a simple app with a dropdown selector that allows the user to choose a year and receive a list of Formula 1 championship standings.
